## Preflight - Unit and integration testing
Preflight is a test framework for [Taxi](https://taxilang.org) and [Orbital](https://orbitalhq.com) projects

Preflight is built in [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org/), on top of [Kotest](https://kotest.io), giving a familiar test syntax, and access to a powerful, standard set of assertions.

In addition, Preflight provides a series of helpers and test utilities to make working with Taxi and Orbital projects easier.

Preflight supports:
* Automatically compiling Taxi projects
* Testing Taxi queries
* Stubbing data sources
* (Planned): Running against real data sources using [Nebula](https://nebula.orbitalhq.com) in tests is planned ([GH Issue](https://github.com/orbitalapi/preflight/issues/2))

Preflight tests are executed using [Gradle](https://gradle.org/) (today), and the Taxi CLI (future). (See [here](#why-gradle) for discussion on why we use Gradle for preflight)

## Getting started
First, add a `build.gradle.kts` file in your Taxi project root (next to your `taxi.conf`) file.

```kotlin
// build.gradle.kts
plugins {
    kotlin("jvm") version "1.9.23"
    id("com.orbitalhq.preflight") version "0.0.3" // Whatever the current latest version is
}
```

You also need a `settings.gradle.kts` (but can be blank)

```kotlin
// settings.gradle.kts
// This file can be left blank
```

Then, to write your first test, create a folder `test` next to your `src` folder.
By convention, these are named ending in `Spec.kt` or `Test.kt`.

```kotlin
// test/HelloWorldSpec.kt
import com.orbitalhq.preflight.dsl.OrbitalSpec
import io.kotest.matchers.shouldBe

class HelloWorldSpec : OrbitalSpec({
    describe("First test") {
        it("should perform a simple assertion") {
              """find { 1 + 2 }""".queryForScalar()
                .shouldBe(3)
        }
    }
})
```

Tests can now be run by executing:

```
gradle test
```

### Recommended - Installing Gradle
Preflight uses Gradle to run tests in your CI/CD.

There's a number of ways of [installing Gradle](https://gradle.org/install/) - a common one is using [SDKMAN!](http://sdkman.io/):

```bash
sdk install gradle
```

or, if using [Homebrew](http://brew.sh/)

```bash
 brew install gradle
```

By convention (and Gradle best practice), Gradle reccomend adding a small lightweight wrapper with Gradle projects,
which makes them portable for users who don't have Gradle installed.

You can generate this by running:

```bash
gradle wrapper
```

This will generate:

 - `gradlew`
 - `gradlew.bat`
 - `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.jar`
 - `gradle/wrapper/gradle-wrapper.properties`

By convention, these files are typically checked into your source control


### Why Gradle?
We plan to provide full support for executing tests using the Taxi CLI, which will make Gradle optional for CI/CD purposes.

However, the Preflight Gradle Plugin offers additional benefits beyond test execution:
- Configures IntelliJ or VSCode source roots for better IDE integration
- Enables Kotlin code completion when writing tests
- Provides a seamless development experience within existing Gradle projects

> **Note**: Code completion is available for Kotlin test code only. IntelliJ does not currently support code completion for Taxi schema files.

For this reason, we plan to support both approaches:
- **Gradle Plugin**: Recommended for development due to superior IDE experience
- **Taxi CLI**: Ideal for lightweight CI/CD pipelines and standalone execution
