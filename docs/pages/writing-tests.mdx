# Writing tests

Tests are written using Kotlin, following Kotest's [Describe spec](https://kotest.io/docs/framework/testing-styles.html#describe-spec) style.

 * Tests are placed anywhere under the `test/` directory of your Taxi project.
 * Test files should be named with a suffix of either `Test.kt` or `Spec.kt`

A custom base class of `OrbitalSpec` is provided, which provides several convenience functions to make testing easier:

```kotlin
import com.orbitalhq.preflight.dsl.OrbitalSpec
import io.kotest.matchers.shouldBe

class PersonTest : OrbitalSpec({
    describe("Simple tests") {
        it("returning a scalar") {
            """find { 1 + 2 }""".queryForScalar()
                .shouldBe(3)
        }
    }
})
```


## Compiling your Taxi project
By default, the taxi project is compiled before any tests are run. If compilation fails, the tests are not executed.

The Taxi project is found by reading the `taxi.conf` file in the root of your Taxi project.


## Test helpers
The OrbitalSpec base class provides a suite of query helper methods designed to make writing tests for Taxi/Orbital projects faster and more expressive.

These helpers let you write and run TaxiQL queries directly within your tests and inspect the results in a Kotlin-native way.

### Query helper methods
All helper methods are defined as [Kotlin Extension functions](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/extensions.html) on the String class, which means you can write queries like this:

```kotlin
"find { 1 + 2 }".queryForScalar() // returns 3
```
This makes it easy to inline small queries directly in your test cases.

#### `queryForScalar`

`queryForScalar(): Any?`

Executes the query and returns the first result as a raw scalar value (e.g., Int, String, Boolean).
Use this for queries that return a single value, like a literal or a single field projection.

```
"find { 6 * 7 }".queryForScalar() shouldBe 42
```

#### `queryForObject`
`queryForObject():Map<String,Any?>`

Executes the query and returns the first result as a map.
Each field in the result is represented as a key-value pair in the returned Map.

Use this when your query returns an object or a record.

```kotlin
it("returns a map when using queryForObject") {
    """given { Person = { id: 123, age: 12 } }
        find { PossibleAdult }
        """.queryForObject()
        .shouldBe(
            mapOf(
                "id" to 123,
                "age" to 12,
                "isAdult" to false
            )
        )
}
```

#### `queryForCollection`
`queryForCollection():List<Map<String,Any?>>`

Executes the query and returns a collection of objects, each represented as a `Map<String, Any?>`.

Use this when your query returns a list or collection of values.

```kotlin
it("returns a list of maps when using queryForCollection") {
        """
        find { [ { name: 'Alice' }, { name: 'Bob' } ] }
        """.queryForCollection()
        .shouldBe(
            listOf(
                mapOf("name" to "Alice"),
                mapOf("name" to "Bob")
            )
        )
}
```

#### `queryForTypedInstance`
`queryForTypedInstance():TypedInstance`

This allows for deeper inspection, such as:

 * Access to field-level types
 * Provenance/lineage tracking
 * Evaluation errors and unresolved values

Useful in lower-level tests where you want to assert not just values, but typing behavior or error diagnostics.


## Stubbing service calls
Each query method supports stubbing external data sources in two ways:

**1. Using Stub Scenarios (Recommended)**
```kotlin
it("should let me customize a stub return value") {
    """
    find { Person(PersonId == 1) } as PossibleAdult
    """.queryForObject(
        stub("getPerson").returns("""{ "id" : 123, "age" : 36 }""")
    )
        .shouldBe(mapOf(
            "id" to 123,
            "age" to 36,
            "isAdult" to true
        ))
}
```


**2. Using Stub Customizer (Advanced)**

```kotlin
it("advanced stub customization") {
    """find { Person(PersonId == 1) }""".queryForObject { stubService ->
        // Fine-grained control over stub configuration
        stub.addResponse("getPerson", """{ "id" : 123, "age" : 36 }""")
    }
}
```

The stub scenarios approach is more convenient for most use cases, while the stub customizer allows for things like
 - controlling responses based on inputs
 - streaming responses (for faking Kafka topics, etc)
 - Throwing errors / simulating failures
