# Tips and FAQ's


### How do I get the command line to show me the tests that have been run?
By default, the Gradle output is quite quiet (compared to Maven or other build tools).

To get more information about tests as they're being run, add the following to your `build.gradle.kts`:

```kotlin
tasks.test {
    testLogging {
        events("started", "passed", "failed", "skipped")
        exceptionFormat = org.gradle.api.tasks.testing.logging.TestExceptionFormat.SHORT
        showStandardStreams = false
    }
}
```

### Where are the test reports
 * An HTML browsable output is created at `build/reports/tests/test/index.html`
 * The standard XML test reports (JUnit style) are at `build/repoirts/test-results/test`


### My test failed, but the two numbers look the same
This is a common issue:

```
io.kotest.assertions.AssertionFailedError: Values differed at keys amount
expected:<{
  "value" = 100
}> but was:<{
  "value" = 100
}>
```

When types in Taxi are declared as `Decimal`, then they are returned to the JVM as `BigDecimal`.

For example, given the model:

```taxi
model Purchase {
  value : Amount inherits Decimal
}
```

Then in a test:

```kotlin
it("should compare decimal numbers") {
    """
    given { Purchase = { value: 20 } }
    find { Purchase }
    """.queryForObject()
        .shouldBe(mapOf(
            "value" to 20, // wrong - don't do this
            "value" to 20.toBigDecimal(), // correct - do this
        ))
}
```
